  <h1>Project Status</h1>

  
  <p>Log4cxx is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
  Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Logging Services
  project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a
  further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
  decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
  other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
  necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
  it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
  ASF.
