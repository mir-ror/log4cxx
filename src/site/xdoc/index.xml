                <h1>About log4cxx</h1>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                <p>Log4cxx is C++ port of <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">Log4j</a>.
                                log4cxx attempts to mimic log4j usage as much as the language will allow
                                and to be compatible with log4j configuration and output formats.</p>

                                <p>
                                        Main concepts of the logging framework are exposed in the
                                        <a href="manual.html">short introduction to log4cxx</a>.
                                </p>


                        <h2>Platforms:</h2>
                                <p>The CVS HEAD is automatically built and tested using the Ant build script
                                several times daily by <a href="http://gump.apache.org">Gump</a>
                                currently using GCC 3.3.5 on Debian Linux i386.  It has been observed or reported 
                                to build and pass tests on
                                using Microsoft C++ 6, 7 and 7.1 and Borland C++ 5.5 on Microsoft Windows and 
                                GCC on SuSE 9.1 x86_64 and i386, Fedora Core 3 i386 and Mac OS X 10.3.</p>

                        <h2>Building log4cxx:</h2>
                                <p>Build instructions are contained in the <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/logging-log4cxx/INSTALL?rev=1.8&amp;view=log">INSTALL</a>.
                                An <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> build which uses the <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/cc.html">&lt;cc&gt;</a> and
                                &lt;foreach&gt; tasks from the <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net">Ant-Contrib Project</a>
                                is used for most day-to-day development.  The Ant build can produce IDE project files for Microsoft Visual
                                Studio 6, Borland CBuilderX and Apple XCode on request.  The Ant build can also download and build 
                                APR and <a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi">CppUnit</a>.  An autotools build file is also provided but at this moment
                                is incompatible with some versions of autotools (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOGCXX-44">LOGCXX-44</a>).</p>
