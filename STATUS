log4cxx is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Logging Services project. 
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision 
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed
by the ASF.


Exit Status:

The minimum requirements that a Podling SHALL meet prior to being successfully
 escalated to the ASF are :

    * Legal
          o All code ASL'ed

carnold: I believe this is satisified.

          o No non ASL or ASL compatable dependencies in the code base
          
carnold: log4cxx currently depends on libxml2 (LGPL) or MSXML for XML configuration.
Migration to Apache Portable Runtime in progress.
          
          o License grant complete          
          o CLAs on file.
          o Check of project name for trademark issues

    * Meritocracy / Community
          o Demonstrate an active and diverse development community
          o The project is not highly dependent on any single contributor 
          (there's at least 3 legally independent committers and there 
          is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project)

carnold: 3 current committers, carnold, mcatan, cdevienne.  I'm independent of the other committers.

          o The above implies that new committers are admitted according to ASF practices
          o ASF style voting has been adopted and is standard practice

carnold: Voting examples:
Migration to APR: http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=log4cxx-dev@logging.apache.org&msgNo=331          
          
          o Demonstrate ability to tolerate and resolve conflict within the community.
          o Release plans are developed and excuted in public by the community.
                + (requriment on minimum number of such releases?)
                + Note: incubator projects are not permitted to issue an official Release. Test snapshots (however good the quality) and Release plans are OK.

carnold: 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 appeared to be released with no public discussion.
0.9.8 discussion: http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=log4cxx-dev@logging.apache.org&msgNo=338


          o Engagement by the incubated community with the other ASF communities, particularly infrastructure@ (this reflects my personal bias that projects should pay an nfrastructure "tax").

carnold: Migrating to Apache Portable Runtime.  I have submitted patches and tests to log4j.

          o Incubator PMC has voted for graduation
          o Destination PMC, or ASF Board for a TLP, has voted for final acceptance

    * Alignment / Synergy
          o Use of other ASF subprojects

carnold: Migrating from previous platform abstract to Apache Portable Runtime

          o Develop synergistic relationship with other ASF subprojects

    * Infrastructure
          o CVS module has been created

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/logging-log4cxx/          
          
          o Mailing list(s) have been created

log4cxx-user@logging.apache.org
log4cxx-dev@logging.apache.org:

          o Mailing lists are being archived

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=218
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=219

          o Bugzilla has been created

http://nagoya.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10550          
          
          o Project website has been created
          
http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/
          
          o Project ready to comply with ASF mirroring guidlines
          o Project is integrated with GUMP if appropriate
          o Releases are PGP signed by a member of the community
          o Developers tied into ASF PGP web of trust
